    <div class="space-y-4 max-w-3xl" id="faq">
      <FaqItem
        question="What is K4MERA ?"
        answer="K4MERA is the first digital wigglegram camera, or stereoscopic camera."
      />
      <FaqItem
        question="What is wigglegram ?"
        answer=`A wigglegram is an animated GIF that creates a 3D-like effect by
          rapidly changing between 4 photos taken from slightly different
          angles.`
      />
      <FaqItem
        question="Why not use a Nishika ?"
        answer=`K4MERA is meant to be a modern, digital Nishika N8000 (or Nimslo 3D),
          opening up not only digital wigglegrams but try new things in the
          photography space. From experience, using a film camera for
          wigglegrams is very time-consuming and leads to a lot of frustration.
          K4MERA reduces all that friction.`
      />
      <FaqItem
        question="Why not use a lens ?"
        answer=`A mounted lens that splits a single view only mimics different angles
          rather than capturing true parallax from separate viewpoints. Our
          4-lens system captures four authentic perspectives simultaneously,
          creating more realistic 3D depth and smoother wigglegram motion.`
      />
      <FaqItem
        question="Why not use AI ?"
        answer=`AI wigglegrams? Sure, but where's the fun in that? Our 4-lens camera
          gives you the real deal - authentic photos you captured yourself, plus
          that satisfying click of a real camera in your hands.`
      />
      <FaqItem
        question="Does K4MERA have a screen ?"
        answer=`Yes! K4MERA features a touch screen so you can preview your shots and
          navigate settings with ease.`
      />
      <FaqItem
        question="Do I still need to use Photoshop to edit the photos ?"
        answer=`Nope! The camera handles all the editing automatically with its
          built-in processing pipeline - just shoot and your wigglegram is ready
          to go. You can still adjust your gifs in the comp4nion app.`
      />
      <FaqItem
        question="Is K4MERA already available ?"
        answer=`Not yet - we're still perfecting it! Join our waitlist to follow our
          progress and we might even ask for your input on some features.`
